# Speaker Tester

Just a hyper-minimal web app to make it easier to test stereo speakers and headphones.

Because if I have to listen to that horrible song in that one YouTube video that helps you test speaker stereo configs, I think I will go insane.

Click the left arrow to play a left-channel only sound. Click the right arrow to play a right-channel only sound. Click the music button to play a stereo sound that should be balanced across both channels. Click the cycle button to automatically play the left/right sounds in an alternating pattern.

You can also use the keyboard: left/right arrows for the left/right buttons, up arrow for the stereo chord, space to toggle auto-play.
